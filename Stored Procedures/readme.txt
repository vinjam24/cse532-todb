the command to run the code is db2 -td@ -f "<code_location>".


the result is stored histogram table.

b) This code was written in Ellipse IDE. The arguments of the main function are in the order:
	binstart, binend, binnum, user, password, database_name.
	
	The driver jar db2cc4.jar is mandatory in the build path. The port number I used for the DB is 25000.
